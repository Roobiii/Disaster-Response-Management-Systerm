**Disaster Response Web Application**
**Overview**
The Disaster Response Web Application is designed to help emergency responders quickly classify and prioritize incoming disaster-related messages. This project uses machine learning to analyze and categorize text messages, enabling efficient resource allocation and response.

**Installation
Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+
pip (Python package installer)
NLTK data packages (punkt, wordnet)


**Dependencies
**
Install the necessary Python packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**NLTK Data**
Download the required NLTK data packages:
import nltk
nltk.download(['punkt', 'wordnet'])

**Project Components**
The project is divided into three main parts:

ETL Pipeline: Extracts data from source files, transforms and cleans the data, and loads it into a SQLite database.
ML Pipeline: Trains a machine learning model to classify disaster messages.
Flask Web App: A web interface for users to input messages and get classification results.

**Usage**
**1. ETL Pipeline**
Run the ETL pipeline script to process the data:
python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db

**2. ML Pipeline**
Run the ML pipeline script to train the model:
python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl

**3. Flask Web App**
Run the Flask web application:
python app/run.py
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3001 to use the web app.

**Data**
**Source**
The dataset used in this project consists of real messages sent during disaster events. It includes:

**disaster_messages.csv**: Contains the messages.
**disaster_categories.csv**: Contains the categories for each message.
**Database**
The processed data is stored in a SQLite database (DisasterResponse.db).

**Model
Training**
The model is a multi-output classifier based on RandomForestClassifier. It is trained to categorize messages into multiple categories such as 'medical help', 'search and rescue', 'water', 'food', etc.

**Evaluation**
The model's performance is evaluated using classification metrics, and a detailed classification report is generated for each category.

**Web Application**
The Flask web application provides a user-friendly interface to classify disaster messages.

**Features**
**Message Input:** Users can input a message into a text box.
**Message Classification:** The app returns the categories that the message belongs to.
**Visualizations: **Displays various visualizations about the dataset.

**
Routes**
/: Main page with the message input form and visualizations.
/go: Page to display the classification results for a user's input message.
